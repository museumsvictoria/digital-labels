## About Digital Labels
The Digital Labels project is a simple self documenting Web API for delivering data that will be used for museum exhibitions labels.

## What Technology does it use?
* ASP.Net Framework 4.5 (Web API).
* RavenDb v2 (build 2360) for persistence.
* IMu Client for connecting to EMu (Museum Collections Management System).
* Ninject for IoC.

## How do I use it?
The Digital Labels source code has been provided for those curious in how it has been put together as there is a dependency on Museum Victoria’s particular flavour of Collection Management which supplies the data that runs the site.  Please feel free to look at and re-use any parts of the code but don’t expect a self-contained project.
